# Spoofing IP and MAC Using Tor

## Overview
This repository contains a project report titled **"Change your IP and MAC using Tor in every 10 seconds."** The report details the methods and outcomes of an experiment exploring how to periodically change your IP and MAC addresses using the Tor network for anonymization purposes. The project was designed to provide insight into network privacy, security, and the challenges of spoofing network identifiers.

## Project Details
- **Objective:**  
  To explore techniques for enhancing online privacy by spoofing IP and MAC addresses using Tor, and to document the methodology, challenges, and outcomes of the process.

- **Methodology:**  
  The report outlines the approach taken to change both the IP and MAC addresses periodically (every 10 seconds). It covers:
  - Using Tor for anonymizing the IP address.
  - System-level techniques to alter the MAC address.
  - The challenges encountered during implementation and testing.

- **Tools & Technologies:**  
  - **Tor:** Utilized for routing network traffic through multiple nodes to hide your original IP.
  - **Git:** Used for version control and collaboration.
  - **System Commands/Tools:** Employed for MAC address spoofing (platform-specific commands).
